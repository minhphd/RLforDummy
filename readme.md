# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Implementation

![LunarLander](./runs/PPo/LunarLanderSol/eval.mov)

## Project Overview
This project is a collection of my implementations of several key Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. It serves as a practical exploration into the field of RL and demonstrates the application of these algorithms in solving complex environments. 

## Implemented Algorithms
In this repository, you will find my implementations of the following algorithms:

1. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Based on the seminal paper by Mnih et al., DQN utilizes deep neural networks to estimate Q-values for action-value pairs.

2. **Semi-RainbowDQN**: An adaptation of the Rainbow DQN algorithm that incorporates several, but not all, enhancements over the standard DQN.

3. **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**: This algorithm combines the benefits of value-based and policy-based RL, using an actor-critic approach.

4. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO is an on-policy algorithm that optimizes a clipped surrogate objective function to balance exploration and exploitation.

## Solved Environment
- **LunarLander-v2**: Each of the implemented algorithms has been sanity-tested on 'CartPole-v1' and used to solve the 'LunarLander-v2' environment from OpenAI Gym. The environment simulates a scenario where the goal is to land a space vehicle on a designated spot. PPO was able to solve 'LunarLander-v2' in less than 1000 episodes.
